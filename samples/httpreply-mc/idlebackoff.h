/*
 * Idle backoff policy for the httpreply-mc run-to-completion worker loop.
 *
 * The worker loop once burned 100% of both vCPUs at all loads, including
 * zero traffic: at idle it ran 1.3-2.3 M no-work loop iterations per
 * second, and each iteration paid a fixed cost (a TSC read, an ARP walk,
 * an epoll lock, hardware queue peeks). [Ticket 597c1b9731]
 *
 * This policy decides, per core and per loop iteration, whether the core
 * may sleep and for how long. It is pure: it takes a monotonic nanosecond
 * time and a work flag, and returns a sleep duration in nanoseconds. The
 * caller performs the actual sleep (a real vCPU halt on the KVM platform).
 *
 * Two regimes:
 *
 * Active: work was seen within the last IB_ACTIVE_WINDOW_NS. After
 * IB_IDLE_STREAK_LIMIT consecutive no-work iterations, the core takes a
 * short fixed sleep (IB_ACTIVE_SLEEP_NS). This bounds the added wake
 * latency during traffic.
 *
 * Dormant: no work for IB_ACTIVE_WINDOW_NS or more. After the streak
 * limit, the sleep budget grows exponentially from IB_LONG_BASE_NS to
 * IB_LONG_MAX_NS and stays there. At zero load the core then spends
 * nearly all of its time halted, so both vCPUs idle. The first request
 * after a dormant period waits at most IB_LONG_MAX_NS to wake a core.
